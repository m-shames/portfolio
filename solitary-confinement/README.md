## Quantitative Research
I have extensive experience working with confidential administrative data from Departments of Corrections, including writing and managing FOIA requests, conducting data quality assessments, de-identifying sensitive datasets, designing and executing exploratory and causal analyses, and communicating findings to legal, academic, and lay audiences.  

Most recently, I conducted a Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) analysis 
evaluating the impact of mandated sentencing guideline reforms arising from the 
*Peoples v. Annucci* settlement.
