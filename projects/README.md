# Repository Overview
This repository contains examples of my quantitative research and analysis work 
related to criminal justice reform.

**Note on Data Confidentiality:** Much of my research involves restricted or confidential data from correctional 
facilities, law enforcement agencies, and legal proceedings. While datasets 
and complete analyses cannot be shared publicly, additional code samples and results 
are available upon request.
