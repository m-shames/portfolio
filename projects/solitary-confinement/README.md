### 3. Statistical & Causal Analysis   
![R version 4.4.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-4.4.3-blue)   


Excerpt from research examining solitary confinement practices in New York State 
using confidential administrative correctional data. Examples provided focus on
evaluating the impact of mandated sentencing guideline reforms in the *Peoples v Annucci* legal settlement.
*Please note, case details and underlying data are confidential.*  

#### Methods   
- Generalized Linear Models & Nonparametric Regression   
- Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT)     
- Network analysis    
- Machine learning (random forests & neural networks)      

***Sample code & visualizations coming soon.***
