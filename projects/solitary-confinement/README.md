## 2. Litigation Support & Monitoring

Provided statistical analyses and data monitoring for civil rights litigation challenging solitary confinement practices in New York State.   

**Responsibilities:**  
- Settlement compliance monitoring and reporting  
- Data quality assessments and validation  
- Statistical analysis for legal filings  
- Data presentations to corrections staff 

**Deliverables include:**  
*V.W. v. Conway*, 236 F. Supp. 3d 554 (N.D.N.Y. 2017): 

  - Shames Decl. in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification  
  - Shames Decl. in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction  
  - Shames Decl. in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment   

*Peoples v. Fischer* (*Peoples v. Annucci*), No. 11-CV-2694 (S.D.N.Y.):   

  - Annual joint status reports on settlement implementation
  - "Solitary confinement by the numbers: Settlement compliance in *Peoples v Annucci*"  
    [Data overview presented annually to NY DOCCS leadership (2017-2023)]

## 3. Quantitative Research   

I have extensive experience working with confidential administrative data from 
Departments of Corrections including:   

  - Writing and managing FOIA requests    
  - Conducting data-quality assessments  
  - De-identifying sensitive datasets    
  - Designing and executing exploratory and causal analyses   
  - Communicating information to legal, academic, and lay audiences      
  
Statistical methods I've used for this work include:

- Generalized Linear Models & Nonparametric Regression   
- Causal Inference Analysis    
- Network Analysis    
- Machine Learning (random forests & neural networks)      

Most recently, I conducted a Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) to evaluate 
the impact of mandated sentencing guideline reforms in the *Peoples v Annucci* legal 
settlement.
