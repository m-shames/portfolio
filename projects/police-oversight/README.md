# Police Oversight Research
Evaluation of Chicago Civilian Review Board (CRB) reforms and their impact on complaint 
investigation and disciplinary outcomes. 

## Background
In 2017, Chicago implemented reforms aimed at strengthening independent police oversight, 
including changes to the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) and the Police Board's authority over disciplinary decisions.

## Objective & Research Questions 
This dissertation research examined:
1. Whether Chicago's civilian oversight reforms causally impacted complaint substantiation rates, disciplinary recommendations, and CPD implementation of CRB recommendations.
2. Whether reforms reduced racial disparities in police misconduct case outcomes.
3. Methodological approaches for causal inference in settings with universal policy compliance and no control group.
