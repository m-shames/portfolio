## About the Code Sample
For part of my dissertation, I evaluated Chicago Civilian Review Board (CRB) reforms and 
their impact on misconduct complaint investigation outcomes and officer discipline. 
The code sample consists of excerpts from various stages of this project. More information about the project is available [here](https://github.com/m-shames/portfolio/tree/updated/police-oversight).
